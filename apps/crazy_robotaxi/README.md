# Crazy Robotaxi

Crazy Robotaxi is a standalone game built on `omnidreams-game-engine` and the
legacy OmniDreams inference session. It does not import or modify the
Interactive Drive demo.

Launch the native game:

```bash
flashdreams-run crazy-robotaxi
```

The dedicated entry point exposes the complete legacy option surface:

```bash
crazy-robotaxi --help
```

Use `--stream-mjpeg HOST:PORT` with either entry point to run the browser HUD
instead of opening a local Vulkan window.
